# TASK BUDDY:

- Develop a responsive task management application using React that empowers users to efficiently create, organize, and track their tasks.

- The application should feature user authentication via Firebase, allowing users to sign in with Google.

- Users should be able to create, edit, and delete tasks, categorize them (e.g., work, personal), and set due dates. Additionally, sorting options based on due dates, and a board/list view to enhance user experience.

- Enable users to perform batch actions on tasks (e.g., delete multiple tasks, mark multiple tasks as complete).
